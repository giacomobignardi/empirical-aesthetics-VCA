# Variance Component Analysis

Code for and examples of partitioning variance in aesthetic ratings using
Variance Component Analysis (VCA).

## 01_VCA

It contains functions and example scripts to calculate the amount of variance ia a given trait of interest (e.g., beauty) that is shared across and/or unique to individuals. It takes into account systematic differences between repeated exposures of the same stimulus.

## 02_rcVCA

It contains functions and examples to get an approximate estimate of the extent to which a state evoked in the individual by sensory stimulation (e.g., perceived self-relevance) or features in the same stimuli (e.g., symmetry) covaries with parts of the variance in other states (e.g., beauty) that is unique or shared to the individual.

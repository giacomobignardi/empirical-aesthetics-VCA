Code and examples of partitioning variance in aesthetic ratings using
Variance Component Analysis (VCA).

## 01_Data

It contains example data obtained from published studies.

## 02_scripts/R

It contains examples .R scripts to run:

-   Variance Component Analysis (VCA): Calculate the amount of variance
    in a given trait of interest (e.g., pleasantness) that is shared
    across and unique to individuals. It takes into account systematic
    differences between repeated exposures of the same stimulus.

-   relative contribution to VCA: Approximately calculate the amount of
    variance partition component "explained" by a given predictor.

Each file is accompanied by a readme file explaining the given script.

## 03_outputs

It contains output from 02_scripts/R

## 04_images

It contains images generated from 02_scripts/R
